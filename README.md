# Firebase Realtime Database: Real-time Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with Firebase Realtime Database where data written to the database doesn't reflect immediately on the client-side application. The client displays stale data, despite successful server-side writes.

## Bug Description

The application uses Firebase Realtime Database to store and retrieve data. While data is successfully written to the database, the client-side application fails to update in real-time, displaying outdated information.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm start`
4. Observe that changes made in the database are not immediately reflected in the application's UI. 

## Solution

A possible solution involves carefully checking database rules, ensuring proper connection handling in the client-side application (including handling of disconnections and reconnections), and verifying the correct usage of listeners and event handlers to efficiently track data changes in Firebase.
